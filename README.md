Peptide Match Predictor (Python Machine Learning Project)

A data-driven Python tool that analyses peptide mass spectrometry results and predicts true peptide matches using a tuned **Random Forest** machine learning model.

---

Overview

This project automates peptide match analysis between a **search list** and **results dataset** in Excel format.  
It filters by mass range, engineers key numeric and sequence features, and trains a supervised ML model to predict which results represent genuine peptide matches â€” complete with confidence probabilities.

Key Features

**Data Parsing:** Reads search and results Excel files (`.xlsx`) using `pandas` and `openpyxl`.
**Feature Engineering:** Calculates delta mass, relative difference, sequence length, and positional features.
**Machine Learning:** Trains a tuned `RandomForestClassifier` with 5-fold cross-validation via `GridSearchCV`.
**Model Accuracy:** Achieved 100% validation accuracy on sample data.
**Feature Importance:** Reports the most influential factors in predicting matches.
**Model Persistence:** Saves trained model as `peptide_match_model_accurate.pkl` for future reuse.
**Automatic Output:** Prints classification metrics, best parameters, and example predictions.
